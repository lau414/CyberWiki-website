# CyberWiki website

This is an HTML project where I create my own website called CyberWiki. The purpose of this website is to give information about the most common cyber-attacks and the most useful tips to protect yourself from them.

This project was done using the online interface Glitch. Here are some images of some of the results.

You can also access the website using this link for the Spanish version: cyberwiki.glitch.me
